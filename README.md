## Inspiration

Rapid technological advancements require businesses to not just adopt new innovations but also ensure their teams have the right skills. Companies often struggle to align employee skills with innovative projects effectively. This inspired us to create StartHubâ€”an AI-powered solution that ensures seamless integration of digital transformation by strategically matching project requirements with employee competencies.

## What it does

StartHub enables managers to efficiently:

- Create and outline innovative projects clearly with defined roles, tasks, training, and implementation requirements.

- Generate comprehensive timelines for project execution and clearly visualize each phase through intuitive Gantt charts.

- Leverage AI-driven recommendations to assign the most suitable employees to project roles based on skills, experience, personality traits, and departmental alignment.

- Easily contact and assign recommended employees directly within the platform.

## How we built it
Frontend: We developed an intuitive UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to ensure user-friendly interactions and responsive visualizations.

Backend: We utilized Flask

Database: SQLite was used for managing and storing project and employee information efficiently.

AI Integration: We utilized OpenAI's GPT-4o API for advanced natural language processing to intelligently recommend **employee-task matches** and **generate optimized project timelines.**
